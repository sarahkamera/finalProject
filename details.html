            allowed.

            featuring an elevated twist on simple yet reliable food who have stood the test of time including: bringing around small
            delicacies throughout the night including spagetti on a stick, hot dog bites, and fruit cups, And for the main meal
            there will be a pizza buffet coming from the local pizza shop</p>

            <p> There is absolutely no sitting on the chairs, to show respect for their special day please do not look down at
            the chairs either, folding chairs do not like to be looked down on, instead sit on the rugs provided. Folding chairs are
            oftentimes not given the luxury of being unique. We encourage all guests to come in black and white attire while
            incorporating your favorite color.</p>
